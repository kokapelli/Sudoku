# Sudoku
Sudoku game made for fun by Hampus Falk. The game is minimalistic and is missing extra auxiliary functionalitites such as the capability to put several potential values in a square. A technique commonly used by more proficient Sudoku solvers. Once a sudoku has been solved, it will create a new one with the click of the mouse, and if a sudoku is proven to be too difficult, just press the shift button and it will solve it for you.

## Issues
1. There is currently no way to terminate the game without using CTRL+C in the executing python terminal. Closing the window or clicking anywhere in the game will cause another game to start. See it as ane xpress solution to the keen Sudoku player.
2. As mentioned above the game is highly minimalistic. Therefore the game can solely accept square values and determine whether you have provided a reasonable solution or not.
3. Auto generated games can create games with several correct solutions, therefore it lacks the bauty and quality of a sudoku with a unique answer.
